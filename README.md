I'm a shiny new developer with a wealth of job experience!

I currently Live in Auckland< New Zealand.

I have just completed the first part of my journey into the world of web development, having completed a bootcamp with Mission Ready HQ
as a Developer. ðŸš€

Through the Mission Ready HQ course I have learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, NodeJs and React. But this has been the tip of the ice burg, we have touched on 
cloud systems, AI, DevOps, CICD and much more! ðŸ¤“

This year has been a year of change, I have come from many years experience in the health and fitness industry. ðŸ’ª 
I have worked with many people, helping to change their health and lives. I have worked one on one with clients and I have presented course here in NZ 
and over in London, teach first aid and Diabetes management respectively.

I am looking forward to introducing my passion for health and wellbeing into the tech industry.
